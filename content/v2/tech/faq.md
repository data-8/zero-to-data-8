# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

The following section contains some frequently asked questions around deploying
Data 8 with JupyterHub. If you have a question that isn't answered, feel free
to [open an issue on the Z2D8 github repository](https://github.com/data-8/zero-to-data-8/issues).

## How can I deploy a JupyterHub on hardware that isn't listed in this guide?

These guides focus on deploying JupyterHub on large cloud providers such as
Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. However, many organizations prefer to deploy on
something other than this (e.g. their own local hardware).

You can deploy a JupyterHub on any hardware, though it must run Kubernetes. 
Setting up Kubernetes is not trivial, so we recommend cloud providers 
as they simplify this process significantly. If there's a specific provider
or setup that you *think* should be officially documented, please reach out and we can discuss!
