# An Educator's Guide to Data 8

Data 8 is a "Foundations in Data Science" course taught for first year students at
UC Berkeley. It combines principles/skills in statistics, programming, inference, modeling,
hypothesis testing, visualization, and exploration. It provides a foundation in
the many fields encompassed by "data science", and gives students a practical introduction
to the field.

This online resource serves as a "snapshot" of the Data 8 stack, and a guide for others
that wish to imitate the Data 8 model. It includes discussion of the
pedagogical approach, concepts / topics covered, and technical pieces used in
the class.

All of the tools that Data 8 uses are **open source**, and available for the community to
use (either as broader community-run projects, or as Berkeley projects). The Data 8 textbook
is free to use at [https://inferentialthinking.com]. If you'd like to modify the textbook's
content for your own course, please shoot us an email!

## This book's structure

See the chapters to the left to navigate this book. Below is a general structure
of the material.

### Deploying your own Data 8 course from scratch

The first section of this guide is a step-by-step guide to deploy your
own version of Data 8. It explains how to create a JupyterHub running in the cloud that students
can access, how to connect this JupyterHub with the coding environment that Data 8 students use,
and how to incorporate course materials into your class. Check it out here:

* [Deploying Data 8](deploy/README)


### Technical and pedagogical decisions for Data 8

These sections are an overview of
the technical and pedagogical pieces that make up Data 8. They are a high-level reference
for running your own Data 8 course, or for taking a similar technical approach to teaching data science.

* [Teaching and Pedagogy](teaching/README) covers the unique blend of computational, coding, and conceptual information taught in Data 8.
* [The Data 8 Tech Stack](tech/README) describes the technical pieces of Data 8, including hosting
  student environments, grading, and managing the course.


### Other Data 8 information

All Data 8 materials are freely available online. The course material in full can be accessed
at the following online resources:

* [The Data 8 Course Site](https://www.data8.org)
* [The Data 8 Course Textbook](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/)

## Other resources

There are many other resources out there for using open technology to facilitate
data analytics pedagogy. Here are a few notable resources:

* [The UC Berkeley JupyterHubs guide](https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/en/latest/) contains
  information about all of the JupyterHubs at UC Berkeley, and is a good reference for how
  our teams coordinate technical infrastructure across classes and resources.
* [The Jupyter for Education Handbook](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/)
  is a more general resource for teaching using tools in the Jupyter ecosystem, and has several
  best-practices and tips.
