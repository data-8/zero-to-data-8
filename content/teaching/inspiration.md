# General concepts

## Major goals
* Diversity
* Equity
* Pedagogical Clarity
* Scalability
* Depth
* No computational barrier to entry

## Core concepts / inspirations
* Think critically about the world around you
* Don't take your data for granted
* Use the combination of CS + Stats as a feature, not a bug
* Come away with practical skills
* Be able to know your inference is sound
* Be able to run your own experiments and plan data collection
* Know the right statistical tools for the job.
* Make due with limited data
* Quantify and understand uncertainty in data
* Turn your data analysis into a decision
* Think of ways that you could be wrong
* Consider edge-cases and how this affects your model choice (e.g. do I want to over/under estimate something)
* Illustrate the above points with real-world data

## Decisions made
* Shield the students from the topics that take away from these main ideas.
* Don't learn a lot of package-specific APIs, use the `datascience` module
* Don't force students to set up their own environments, use a JupyterHub
* Don't force students to clean their own data, provide pre-collected/cleaned data
* Provide videos and extra help if students want to go further.
* Expect subsequent courses to cover these more rigorously
* Aim the course for *anybody*, not just statistics or CS majors.
* More advanced treatment of these topics / formalization of CS/stats concepts will happen in later classes

## Interactions of topics
* Intersectionality is a feature, not a bug
* Use CS concepts to help teach statistics, and vice versa
* Learn computing skills by doing interesting things on data
* Learn statistical concepts by observing something interesting in data, or a product of an algorithm.
* Use interactivity to let people explore the above concepts at their own trajectory.
