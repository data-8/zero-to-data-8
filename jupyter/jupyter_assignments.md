# Jupyter Notebook Assignments

The assignments in Data 8 consist of **Labs**, **Homeworks**, and **Group Projects**. Labs are mostly used as a guide through the class material, whereas homeworks and projects are also used for course grading. All of the assignments use a package called [Otter-Grader](https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/) for auto-grading. This can be used in two primary ways:

1. Public tests are run on the students notebook as the student moves through the material in order to give live feedback and evaluate student answers.
2. Grading is performed using a suite of public and private tests in order to assign points. This can be done from the command-line of an instructors computer, online at [otter-grader-standalone](https://grader.datahub.berkeley.edu) or using a paid services like [GradeScope](https://gradescope.com).

The latest links to the homeworks can be found in the course page for the current
semester. For example, the Spring 2025 course can be found [here.](http://data8.org/sp25/)

These materials are freely available [here](https://github.com/data-8/materials-fds) and you can find the homeworks for this repository [here.](https://github.com/data-8/materials-fds/tree/master/hw)
