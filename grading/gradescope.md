# Grading with GradeScope

**Step 1: Institutional License, GradeScope and Canvas**

GradeScope is a **paid** service that allows instructors to tie assignments back to Canvas. Once an assignment is created in Canvas and in GradeScope, a student uploads their completed notebook to GradeScope, GradeScope grades the notebook and pushes the scores back to the LMS.

**Step 2: Documentation: Canvas and GradeScope Assigment Configuration**

This documentation from [GradeScope](https://help.gradescope.com/article/y10z941fqs-instructor-canvas) details how to configure a GradeScope course and assignments with Canvas.

**Step 3: Documentation: GradeScope Programming Assignments**

This documentation from [GradeScope](https://help.gradescope.com/article/ujutnle52h-instructor-assignment-programming) illustrates how to tie the autograder.zip file to a GradeScope assignment to enable automatic grading. There is also section on combining manual and autograded questions. 

Note here, that we have all the autograder.zip files needed for the programming assignments, the configuration of these assignments should be very straight-forward.
