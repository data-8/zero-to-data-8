# Grading Locally

You can grade notebooks on your own machine. The configuration and packages you need to install otter-grader are detailed in the documentation:

- [Installation of otter-grader](https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/en/v4.4.1/index.html#installation)

The only caveat is that the Data 8 notebooks you are using are configured with otter-grader version 4.4.1 so when you install otter-grader you want to install version 4.4.1:
`pip install otter-grader==4.4.1`

You will also need to install Docker:
- [Installation of Docker](https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/en/v4.4.1/index.html#docker)

Once you have installed the components above, we reccommend you move through this [tutorial](https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/en/v4.4.1/tutorial.html). The final step illustrates how to grade.

Finally, the [command line reference](https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/en/v4.4.1/cli_reference.html#otter-grade) for the command `otter grade` details the various options you have related to grading.
